# CS723_ESTEREL

How to run:
1. Download file directory, ensuring it is on the desktop not a networked drive (tsclient drive in FlexIT prevents compilation).
2. Optional: Run "make clean" to remove any files from the previous build.
3. Run "make CruiseController.xes"
4. Once the file is successfully built, run "./CruiseController.xes"
5. You should now be able to see inputs and outputs in a pop-up window.
